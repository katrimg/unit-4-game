### This project utilizes html, css, javascript, and jquery

## How the game works:

The Crystal Collector game starts with a random number being generated, as well as four hidden random numbers generated for crystals. The user clicks on the crystals trying to add up their values to reach the origional number.
If the user hits the number, their wins increase by one. If they go over the number, their losses increase by one.
